## Weak 1( Introduction to Data Science )

In this week I theory learned the basic of data Science such as 
### what is Data Science:
In this section i learned the basic defination of data science and the key elements of Data Science such as (Machine learning, statistical analysis, Data visualization, and data-
driven decision making)

### The importance of Data Science:
In this Section i learned why data science is important and some industries that uses Data science such as ( Health care,finance, marketing, and technology )

### Data Science Process:
Hear i learnd about the Data collention Process Steps.
* Data collention.
* Data cleaning and processing.  
* Statistical analysis and modeling.
* Machine learning and predictive modeling.
* Data visualization and communication.
* Developing data-driven solutions to real-world problems.
The process is iterative and involves going back and forth between different steps as necessary
### Data Science Tools and Technologies:
i learned about the different tools which are used in the data Science filed such as programiming language, librarys, modeling tools and frameworks.
### Data Science Skills:
The Skills require for Data Science are borblem solving, programiming, Data modeling and statistical.

## weak 2 (Introduction to python)
In this weak we learnded how to write basic python commands and learned the use of 
* Functions
* Types and sequences
* Strings
* Reading and writing CVS Files
* Using Dates and Times
* Objects and Map()
* Lambda and List Comprehensions

### Introduction to Numpy:
Numpy is the fundamental package for numeric computing with python. it provides powerful ways to create store and manipilate data. In this lecture we learned how to:
* Create Arrays.
* Selecting Elements from Arrays.
* Loading dataset into an array.
