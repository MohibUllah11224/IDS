## Weak 1( Introduction to Data Science )

In this week I theory learned the basic of data Science such as 
### what is Data Science:
In this section i learned the basic defination of data science and the key elements of Data Science such as (Machine learning, statistical analysis, Data visualization, and data-
driven decision making)

### The importance of Data Science:
In this Section i learned why data science is important and some industries that uses Data science such as ( Health care,finance, marketing, and technology )

### Data Science Process:
Hear i learnd about the Data collention Process Steps.
* Data collention.
* Data cleaning and processing.  
* Statistical analysis and modeling.
* Machine learning and predictive modeling.
* Data visualization and communication.
* Developing data-driven solutions to real-world problems.
The process is iterative and involves going back and forth between different steps as necessary
### Data Science Tools and Technologies:
i learned about the different tools which are used in the data Science filed such as programiming language, librarys, modeling tools and frameworks.
### Data Science Skills:
The Skills require for Data Science are borblem solving, programiming, Data modeling and statistical.

## weak 2 (Introduction to python)
In this weak we learnded how to write basic python commands and learned the use of 
* Functions
* Types and sequences
* Strings
* Reading and writing CVS Files
* Using Dates and Times
* Objects and Map()
* Lambda and List Comprehensions

### Introduction to Numpy:
Numpy is the fundamental package for numeric computing with python. it provides powerful ways to create store and manipilate data. In this lecture we learned how to:
* Create Arrays.
* Selecting Elements from Arrays.
* Loading dataset into an array.
Numpy array is same as python dictionary but the main differences is that it is faster and provide bultin function that make our work easy.
## Weak 3 (Data Types and Sources)
### Data:
 Data is raw fact and figures that do not convay any infromation on its own. same data can convay different meaning accouding to its Types. 
 ###Data Types
 There are two types of data
 #### Quantitative data:
 This type data is numaric in nature which is divided in to two parts 
 * continues data
 * discreate data.

 #### Qualitative data:
 This type of data is discriptive in nature and is also divided into two parts.
 * nominal data
 * ordinal data

## Weak 4 (Data Cleaning and Preprocessing)
### Scaling
scaling is used to con vert data with differen values or scale in to the same scale. 
some types of scales are :
* min max scale
* standard scale
### mearging
some time when we are working with data we have data in two different files or table in that case we want to mearge the files

### Pivot Tables

A pivot table is a way of summarizing data in a DataFrame for a particular purpose. It makes heavy use of the aggregation function. A pivot table is itself a DataFrame, where the rows represent one variable that you're interested in, the columns another, and the cell's some aggregate value. A pivot table also tends to includes marginal values as well, which are the sums for each column and row. This allows you to be able to see the relationship between two variables at just a glance.
### synatx 
df.pivot_table(values='score', index='country', columns='Rank_Level', aggfunc=[np.mean]).head();

parameters:
* Data
* Value 
* index
* column
### Aggfunct():
These are list of numpy function that we can use to aggregate out piviot table. the defauly aggregate argument function mean.

## Weak 5 (Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA))
EDA is an approch thst is used to analuze the data and discover trends, patteren or checks assumption in data with help of ststistical summaries and graphical representations.
### Types of EDA
 Depending on the number of columns we are analayze or dealing with we divide EDA into Two types:
 * Univariate Analysis
 * Multivariate Analysis
